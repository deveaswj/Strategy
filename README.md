# Strategy
From a Udemy course: [The Ultimate Guide to Making a 2D Strategy Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-2d-strategy-game-in-unity/)

This project has a *lot* of sprite assets, because when I started this, I wasn't sure which ones I would be using.

Features I plan to implement:
- [ ] Hand-designed maps, not randomized as the tutorial has.
- [ ] A roads system that allows for bonus movement.

Ideas for future improvements:
- [ ] Use Unity's built-in Tilemap System and Rule Tiles
- [ ] Generate roads and terrain procedurally.
