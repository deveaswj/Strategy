# Strategy
From a Udemy course: [The Ultimate Guide to Making a 2D Strategy Game in Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-making-a-2d-strategy-game-in-unity/)

This project has a *lot* of sprite assets, because when I started this, I wasn't sure which ones I would be using.

Features I plan to implement:
- [x] A roads system that allows for bonus movement.
- [x] Scattered rubble, and units (e.g. Trucks) that can collect it.
- [ ] Let Dozers run into obstacles to convert them into rubble.
- [ ] Let Dozers create dirt roads on bare terrain.

Ideas for future improvements:
- [ ] Use Unity's built-in Tilemap System and Rule Tiles.
- [ ] Generate initial roads and terrain procedurally.
